UID Innovation center worked with more than 6.28 Crore resident names in English and Marathi.\n\n
The English Names and Marathi names were cleaned by removing white spaces, special characters and rejecting records with ambiguous characters.\n\n

The clean database of names where then broken into words by separating First name, last name, middle name by considering space as delimiter
which generated around 15.66 crore pairs of Marathi,English Name.\n\n

These 15.66 crore pairs of English, Marathi equivalent were grouped into 32 Lakh unique pairs, with frequency count.\n\n

As a further cross check, the Marathi word was then transliterated to English Using GIST tool provided by CDAC.\n\n
The English transliteration was then compared to original English word, through fuzzy matching, using Algorithm Approximate Matching of Indian Names (AMIN).\n\n
AMIN is based on careful analysis of Indian names and surnames, and is a huge improvement over existing such algorithms.\n\n

This validated, quite clean English-Marathi dictionary of Names and Surnames, containing about 3,00,000 pairs with frequency count (covering 96% of total words)
can be useful to many programmers, and Researchers working in this area.\n\n

My team collected name from above link which was more than 3 lakh Unique English Marathi pair Name.\n
We removed some Name from list by combining other for example\n\n
	WORD_ENGLISH     WORD_MARATHI	    FREQUENCY\n
	AKSHAY	                               अक्षय	             101128\n
	AKSHY	                               अक्षय	             2832\n
	AKSHYA	                               अक्षय	             2082\n
	AKASHAY             अक्षय	             1631\n
	AXAY	                               अक्षय	             167\n\n

	these type name were in dataset as unique pair with frequency which is true but these are same name as their marathi name is same
	so I combined all name as single with most occuring pair.\n\n
	result Name:\n
	      WORD_ENGLISH     WORD_MARATHI	    FREQUENCY \n
	      AKSHAY	                               अक्षय	         107840 \n

	WORD_ENGLISH	WORD_MARATHI	FREQUENCY
	MEENA	                               मीना	         54050
	MEENA	                              मिना	         8209
	MEENA	                              मीणा	         194
	MEENA	                              मिणा	         14

	these are also unique pair with frequency which is true but these are same name as their English name is same
	so same operation is repeated on this.
	result Name:
          MEENA	                               मीना	         62467

Thanks to UID team whose work is becoming useful for app developer and researcher this application is because of data provided by UID team.
It would be pleasure if any parent found it useful for their child Name searching.

Thanks for downloading.
