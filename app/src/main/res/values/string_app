    <string name="about_info">
        &lt;P>UID Innovation center worked with more than 6.28 Crore resident names in English and Marathi.
        The English Names and Marathi names were cleaned by removing white spaces, special characters and rejecting records with ambiguous characters.&lt;p>

&lt;P>The clean database of names where then broken into words by separating First name, last name, middle name by considering space as delimiter
which generated around 15.66 crore pairs of Marathi,English Name.&lt;P>

&lt;/br>These 15.66 crore pairs of English, Marathi equivalent were grouped into 32 Lakh unique pairs, with frequency count.\n\n

&lt;P>As a further cross check, the Marathi word was then transliterated to English Using GIST tool provided by CDAC.\n\n
The English transliteration was then compared to original English word, through fuzzy matching, using Algorithm Approximate Matching of Indian Names (AMIN).\n\n
AMIN is based on careful analysis of Indian names and surnames, and is a huge improvement over existing such algorithms.\n\n

&lt;P>This validated, quite clean English-Marathi dictionary of Names and Surnames, containing about 3,00,000 pairs with frequency count (covering 96% of total words)
can be useful to many programmers, and Researchers working in this area.\n\n

&lt;P>more information is provided on <link> https://aadhaar.maharashtra.gov.in/1077/UID-Innovation-Lab?format=print</link>\n\n

&lt;P>My team collected name from above link which was more than 3 lakh Unique English Marathi pair Name.\n
&lt;br>We removed some Name from list by combining other for example\n\n

<string name="about_below">
	&lt;P>these name were in dataset as unique pair with frequency but these are same name as their marathi name is same
	so I combined all these to single name with most occuring pair.\n\n
	result Name:\n
